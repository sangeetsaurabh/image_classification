# Convolutional neural network for image Classification

Images from the CIFAR-10 dataset are classified. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. 
Images are preprocessed, then a convolutional neural network is trained on all the samples. The images are normalized 
and the labels are one-hot encoded.
